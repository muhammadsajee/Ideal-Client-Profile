# Ideal-Client-Profile
While working for StaffCircle, I undertook a project using unsupervised machine learning techniques to create an ideal client profile. 
By analyzing customer data, we were able to identify key characteristics of our ideal clients, such as demographics, behaviors, and preferences. 
These insights allowed us to create targeted marketing campaigns that resonated with our ideal clients, resulting in increased engagement and sales. 
The project demonstrated the value of using machine learning in digital marketing and provided valuable insights to inform future marketing strategies.
